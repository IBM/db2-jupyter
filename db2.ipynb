    "# DB2 Jupyter Notebook Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Version: 2022-04-05\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is imported as a Jupyter notebook extension in any notebooks you create with DB2 code in it. Place the following line of code in any notebook that you want to use these commands with:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "&#37;run db2.ipynb\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a Jupyter/Python magic command called `%sql` which allows you to execute DB2 specific calls to \n",
    "the database. There are other packages available for manipulating databases, but this one has been specifically\n",
    "designed for demonstrating a number of the SQL features available in DB2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of executing the `%sql` command. A single line SQL statement would use the\n",
    "line format of the magic command:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "If you have a large block of sql then you would place the %%sql command at the beginning of the block and then\n",
    "place the SQL statements into the remainder of the block. Using this form of the `%%sql` statement means that the\n",
    "notebook cell can only contain SQL and no other statements.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "ORDER BY LASTNAME\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "You can have multiple lines in the SQL block (`%%sql`). The default SQL delimiter is the semi-column (`;`).\n",
    "If you have scripts (triggers, procedures, functions) that use the semi-colon as part of the script, you \n",
    "will need to use the `-d` option to change the delimiter to an at \"`@`\" sign. \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql -d\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "@\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE ...\n",
    "@\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%sql` command allows most DB2 commands to execute and has a special version of the CONNECT statement. \n",
    "A CONNECT by itself will attempt to reconnect to the database using previously used settings. If it cannot \n",
    "connect, it will prompt the user for additional information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CONNECT command has the following format:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql CONNECT TO &lt;database&gt; USER &lt;userid&gt; USING &lt;password | ?&gt; HOST &lt;ip address&gt; PORT &lt;port number&gt; [SSL &lt;filename&gt;]\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "If you use a \"`?`\" for the password field, the system will prompt you for a password. This avoids typing the \n",
    "password as clear text on the screen. If a connection is not successful, the system will print the error\n",
    "message associated with the connect request.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the connection is successful, the parameters are saved on your system and will be used the next time you\n",
    "run a SQL statement, or when you issue the %sql CONNECT command with no parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the -d option, there are a number different options that you can specify at the beginning of \n",
    "the SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `-d, -delim` - Change SQL delimiter to \"`@`\" from \"`;`\"\n",
    "   - `-q, -quiet` - Quiet results - no messages returned from the function\n",
    "   - `-r, -array` - Return the result set as an array of values instead of a dataframe\n",
    "   - `-j` - Format the first character column of the result set as a JSON record\n",
    "   - `-json` - Return result set as an array of json records\n",
    "   - `-a, -all` - Return all rows in answer set and do not limit display\n",
    "   - `-grid` - Display the results in a scrollable grid\n",
    "   - `-e, -echo` - Any macro expansions are displayed in an output box \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "You can pass python variables to the `%sql` command by using the `{}` braces with the name of the\n",
    "variable inbetween. Note that you will need to place proper punctuation around the variable in the event the\n",
    "SQL command requires it. For instance, the following example will find employee '000010' in the EMPLOYEE table.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "empno = '000010'\n",
    "%sql SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO='{empno}'\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to use parameter markers. What you would need to do is use the name of the variable with a colon in front of it and the program will prepare the statement and then pass the variable to Db2 when the statement is executed. This allows you to create complex strings that might contain quote characters and other special characters and not have to worry about enclosing the string with the correct quotes. Note that you do not place the quotes around the variable even though it is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "empno = '000020'\n",
    "%sql SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO=:empno\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development SQL\n",
    "The previous set of `%sql` and `%%sql` commands deals with SQL statements and commands that are run in an interactive manner. There is a class of SQL commands that are more suited to a development environment where code is iterated or requires changing input. The commands that are associated with this form of SQL are:\n",
    "- AUTOCOMMIT\n",
    "- COMMIT/ROLLBACK\n",
    "- PREPARE \n",
    "- EXECUTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocommit is the default manner in which SQL statements are executed. At the end of the successful completion of a statement, the results are commited to the database. There is no concept of a transaction where multiple DML/DDL statements are considered one transaction. The `AUTOCOMMIT` command allows you to turn autocommit `OFF` or `ON`. This means that the set of SQL commands run after the `AUTOCOMMIT OFF` command are executed are not commited to the database until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "`COMMIT` (`WORK`) will finalize all of the transactions (`COMMIT`) to the database and `ROLLBACK` will undo all of the changes. If you issue a `SELECT` statement during the execution of your block, the results will reflect all of your changes. If you `ROLLBACK` the transaction, the changes will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PREPARE` is typically used in a situation where you want to repeatidly execute a SQL statement with different variables without incurring the SQL compilation overhead. For instance:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = %sql PREPARE SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO=?\n",
    "for y in ['000010','000020','000030']:\n",
    "    %sql execute :x using :y\n",
    "```\n",
    "`EXECUTE` is used to execute a previously compiled statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the error codes that might be associated with any SQL call, the following variables are updated after every call:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQLCODE\n",
    "* SQLSTATE\n",
    "* SQLERROR - Full error message retrieved from Db2"
