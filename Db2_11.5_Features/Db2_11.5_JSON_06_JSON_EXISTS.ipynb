    "When working with the Db2 JSON functions, you have the ability to provide a search path indicating how to find the JSON keys of interest in the document. What should happen in the event that your path expression cannot find the key that was requested? Should an error be raised, or a default value be returned? These are decisions which you should consider before you begin to access JSON documents in order to ensure that the results you get back follow a consistent standard.\n",

    "To give this discussion some context, let's first define the type of \"awkward\" situations which an innocent path expression might potentially encounter when exploring a JSON document:\n",

    "2. The Path expression is invalid (i.e. it does not follow the standard path syntax)\n",
    "3. There is a structural error in the document\n",
    "   1. The key that you are attempting to retrieve does not exist\n",
    "   2. The array value requested does not exist (out of bounds)\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow you to have control over the behavior of your query, the standard includes two keywords, `lax` and `strict`, for the path expression which determine how structural errors will be handled. The ISO JSON SQL standard also provides mechanisms for dealing with missing keys, improper documents, or invalid path expressions (the `ON EMPTY` and `ON ERROR` clauses). "

    "* A missing object or element \n",
    "* Accessing an array without specifying the index value\n",
