    "## Unnesting Arrays\n",
    "One of the challenges of dealing with JSON objects is how to handle arrays of values. The relational model was never designed to deal with a column of data that could be an array so alternate techniques have to be used.\n",
    "The `JSON_QUERY` function can be used to retrieve the entire contents of an array, while `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_TABLE` can extract the individual elements. However, what method is available to extract all of the elements of an array when the actual array size is unknown?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have the JSON array `[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"]` and we want to have the elements returned from an SQL query in a result set like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RESULTS\n",
    "-------\n",
    "A\n",
    "B\n",
    "C\n",
    "```\n",
    "How would we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete implementation of the ISO SQL definition for `JSON_TABLE` would have that function handle this case by returning multiple rows with all the other row values duplicated but the Db2 implementation of `JSON_TABLE` is not yet at that stage of maturity and cannot handle this scenario. There is an older, proprietary Db2 JSON function (unfortunately) also called `JSON_TABLE` that is part of the `SYSTOOLS` schema that can be used to generate a simple result set where each row  represents an element from the array, but this function does not return multiple values per row and is also not compliant with the ISO SQL JSON standard. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to retrieve all the elements of an array as a series of independent values, we have to combine all three new ISO JSON functions (`JSON_EXISTS`, `JSON_VALUE`, `JSON_QUERY`) in a recursive SQL query to retrieve them. "
