    "# An Introduction to JSON\n",
    "Updated: 2019-10-03\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that you have already heard of JSON and programs that store and manipulate JSON. JSON is an acronym for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" and is a way of representing data in a specific format. JSON objects are data structures which can contain a variety of data types including arrays. In this document, a single JSON object is referred to as a **record** while a series of JSON records is called a **collection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A JSON record consists of one or more of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JSON object\n",
    "* JSON array \n",
    "* JSON string \n",
    "* JSON number\n",
    "* JSON literal of **`true`**, **`false`**, or **`null`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A JSON object consists of zero or more **key-value** or **name-value** pairs with the entire object enclosed in curly braces **`{}`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a simple JSON object:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"first\" : \"Tom\",\n",
    "  \"last\"  : \"Hronis\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two keys found in this object: **first** and **last**. The values associated with these keys are **Tom** and **Hronis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sections below describe in more detail the various components that can make up a JSON record."

    "### Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "A key-value pair consists of a key (identifier) followed by a colon \":\" and then the value associated with the key. The value can be any of the JSON types including another JSON object. \n",
    "A key-value pair is shown below:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"author\" : \"Paul\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "From a traditional Db2 perspective, the term \"key\" implies that there is some index structure available to quickly search for a specific value. This is not the case with JSON key-value pairs. While a JSON key is indeed used to find the appropriate key-value pair in a JSON object, this is done by searching through the entire object for a match; a JSON key does not offer any quick access mechanism into the object itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple key-value pairs in the same JSON document are separated by commas, with each pair containing individual key and value components separated by a colon. The key-value pairs can be in any order and be nested or arranged in arrays. Other objects in the same collection can have different key-value pairs or even different representations of a key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a JSON object with multiple key-value pairs:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"author\" : \"Paul\",\n",
    "  \"penname\": \"El Magnifico\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is an example of a slightly more complex JSON object:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"author\" : [\"Paul\",\"George\"],\n",
    "  \"location\": \"Toronto, Ontario, Canada\",\n",
    "  \"favorite colour\" : \n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"George\" : \"Mauve\",\n",
    "      \"Paul\"   : \"Chartreuse\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While, as a rule, keys should not be duplicated in the same JSON object, it is perfectly fine as long as the duplicate key values are not at the same level in that object. The following document is not considered to have a duplicate \"author\" key because the second occurrence is part of another JSON object, coauthors, which is nested within the first JSON object:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"author\" : \"Paul\",\n",
    "  \"coauthors\" : \n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"author\" : \"George\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the two author key values do not appear at the same level in the same JSON object and so are not considered to be duplicates."

    "### Key and Value Structures\n",
    "A key value is always a JSON string type and must be enclosed in double quotes (`\"first\"`). Some systems allow the use of names without quotes as long as they do not use any special characters or blanks, but Db2 follows the current definition of a JSON string to avoid ambiguity and requires that JSON strings should always be enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no requirement that keys follow a naming convention, but there are a number of accepted practices including using lowercase characters for the key names and not using JSON special characters in the name. For instance, the period `\".\"` is used as part of JSON path specification (reviewed in the section JSON Path Expressions), so including it in a key name could be confusing. Similarly, the colon `\":\"` is used to separate the key and value pairs."

    "### Escape Characters\n",
    "There are a couple of situations where you will need to use escape characters when using JSON:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using non-printable characters or JSON special characters as part of a key or a value\n",
    "* Creating a JSON path expression to an object which contains special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The characters which are used as part of JSON path expression are the dot (.), dollar ($), asterisk (*), and brackets ([]). If you have a document with object names that use any of these characters, path expressions may run into problems during their evaluation.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"author\": {\"first.name\":\"Paul\",\"last.name\":\"Bird\",\"salary$\": 66500}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, attempting to create JSON path expressions to last.name won't work!\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.author.last.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "The path expression interprets this as trying to retrieve the contents of an object called author that contains another object called last that contains a key name. To avoid this problem, you can use the backslash character (`\\`) to escape the special character.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.author.last\\.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practice would be to avoid creating object names that have any of the special characters in it, but that isn't always possible when data is loaded in from other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data that contains special characters, you can use the escape character (`\\`) before the special character or use the Unicode escape sequence for the character using the format `\\u0000`. The following table summarizes the escape sequences in JSON documents.\n",

    "### Scalar Values\n",
    "The value associated with a key can be a simple scalar, another JSON object, or a JSON array. A simple scalar is either a JSON string, JSON number, or the JSON literal of \"true\", \"false\", or \"null\". The following example contains all simple scalar values:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON numbers can contain decimal places or exponential notation. The values are not converted to numeric types when stored as JSON in Db2. The values are kept in their character form and only converted to a SQL representation when retrieved. This means that there is no loss of precision when storing the JSON, but there may be some loss when the character representation gets translated to a native SQL data type if the receiving type is not compatible."

    "### Object Values\n",
    "The value associated with a key can be another JSON object. Objects can be nested in a JSON structure to any arbitrary level. Application developers attempt to limit the depth of JSON structures to reduce the complexity of retrieving individual objects.\n",
    "The following JSON document contains two nested objects - one for the name, and another for the address.\n",

    "### Array Values\n",
    "JSON allows for arrays to be used as part of the key-value pairs. Arrays are an ordered sequence of zero or more values and are enclosed in square brackets â€” [...]. Note that values in the array can be scalars, objects, or arrays. There is no limit to the complexity of array objects but keeping the levels to a minimum reduces the chance for errors.\n",

    "Usually JSON arrays would contain the same type of value (e.g. all integers or all character strings), however, JSON does not prevent a user from creating an array with different value types, even though that goes against the philosophy of what arrays are supposed to be! The following example shows three different JSON value types being used as elements.\n",
    "```json\n",

    "JSON arrays are often populated with JSON objects. Consider a record that contains payment information for a customer. A customer could have a variety of credit cards that they use to purchase merchandise, and this can be modelled using an array with objects.\n",

    "```json\n",
    "{\n",

    "With the ability to nest scalars, objects, and arrays, JSON records can be arbitrarily complex. The structure and complexity of an object is left up to the developer without the need to pre-define what the object will contain.

    "### Missing Values\n",
    "A critical difference between JSON and other data representation approaches, such as XML, is that there is no schema defined or enforced for the contents of a JSON document. Other than validating the basic JSON grammar elements (e.g. curly braces at beginning and end, colon between key and value, etc.), JSON sets no expectations on the content itself. The definition and integrity checking for key-value pairs is left to the application developer and are not enforced by JSON. And, while there are some common conventions such as a key should only appear once in the same JSON object, this is not enforced by JSON itself unless explicitly requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "This inherent flexibility of JSON provides great freedom to the developer to change and evolve the data representation over time. Any JSON document can be modified by adding new name-value pairs, even with names that were never considered when the object was created. For instance, you can model an individual's first and last name as illustrated in the following JSON document:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"first\" : \"Paul\",\n",
    "  \"last\"  : \"Bird\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "What would need to happen if the individual had a middle name? You simply add another key-value pair to the record!\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"first\" : \"Paul\",\n",
    "  \"middle\": \"Who\",\n",
    "  \"last\"  : \"Bird\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "From a processing perspective, one of the results of this freedom is that JSON objects can suffer from effects such as these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing key-value pair(s) required by the processing\n",
    "* Mismatched keys due to case differences (e.g. key \"name\" is not a match with key \"nAme\" or key \"Name\")\n",
    "* Duplicate keys in the same JSON object\n",
    "\n",
    "These effects can be further aggravated when JSON objects are stored within a database as the objects become effectively \"frozen\" at that time and, unless enhanced by later maintenance, do not reflect subsequent changes made by the application developer. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the effects listed above have consequences which typically show up when querying JSON objects. In most cases, the result is simply that the desired key is not found but in the case of duplicate keys, the results could vary for each query depending on the access approach used. This is why JSON query implementations lay down specific rules on how duplicate keys will be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Db2 is faithful to the JSON philosophy and will only check that the JSON document itself is structurally correct. When duplicate keys are encountered, Db2 will only return the first instance of a key except for those specific functions which provide the user the ability to explicitly dictate what should happen when duplicate keys are detected."

    "## Data Type Representation of JSON Records\n",
    "JSON is convenient for developers for a number of reasons. The previous section described the flexibility of JSON and how it can be modified without having to deal with schemas. The other benefit of JSON is that it is human \"readable\" since it is just a character string. The data is presented in a form that doesn't require any conversion or formatting of the data to make sense of it. This makes the process of interchanging the data without other applications and systems much simpler and convenient for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whitespace (blanks) found in the various examples above are ignored. This allows a developer to format the record in a way that makes it easy to read and understand its structure. Indentation and spacing are used for formatting and clarifying the structure of the record for similar reasons. There is no requirement in JSON itself for this extraneous formatting, it is strictly for the benefit of the human eye."

    "JSON is an acronym for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" and is a way of representing data in a specific format using text so that both humans and programs can read them. While JSON is a very flexible approach to representing data, it is also very loose in its enforcement of consistency and integrity for the data being represented, leaving these duties to the application and the developer."
