    "Up to this point, the notebooks have explored functions that can be used to check for the existence of an object and retrieve individual values. While these functions can be used to retrieve all of the values within a JSON document by using multiple calls, an easier method exists in the form of the new `JSON_TABLE` function based on the ISO SQL standard. While this function does not yet implement all of the ISO `JSON_TABLE` function definition, the part that has been implemented in Db2 is still very useful and can help simplify things for you. "
