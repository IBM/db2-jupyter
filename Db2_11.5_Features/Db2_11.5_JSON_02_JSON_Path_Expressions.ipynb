    "JSON documents have an inherent structure to them, similar to XML documents or a file system. Many of the JSON functions provided with Db2 need a method to navigate through a document to retrieve the object or item that the user wants. To illustrate how a JSON path expression points to a particular object, one of the customer documents will be used:\n",

    "### Document Structure\n",
    "Every JSON path expression begins with a dollar sign (`$`) to represent the root or top of the document structure. To traverse down the document, the dot/period (`.`) is used to move down one level. The \"`$`\" and \"`.`\" characters are reserved characters for the purposes of path expressions so care needs to be taken not to use them as a part of a key name in a key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our customer document example, to refer to the value associated with the customerid key, the path expression would be:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.customerid\n",
    "```\n",
    "To retrieve the value associated with the identity key, the path expression would be:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.identity\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value referred to in this last example is the entire JSON object that is the value associated with identity so the following object would be returned:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "   \"firstname\": \"Jacob\",\n",
    "   \"lastname\" : \"Hines\",\n",
    "   \"birthdate\": \"1982-09-18\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we needed to traverse the interior of the JSON OBJECT value associated with identity, for example to refer to the birthdate, then we would append the initial key name with a period and the internal key name for the value of interest:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.identity.birthdate\n",
    "Result: \"1982-09-18\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Up to this point, we have only been referring to objects and individual key-value pairs within a JSON document. JSON allows for the use of simple arrays (such as phone numbers) or for arrays of objects (like purchases). \n",
    "A simple and complex array type are shown below:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"employee\": 10,\n",
    "  \"phoneno\": [\"592-533-9042\",\"354-981-0032\",\"919-778-1539\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"division\": 5,\n",
    "  \"stores\" : \n",
    "    [\n",
    "      {\"id\": 45, \"city\" : \"Toronto\"},\n",
    "      {\"id\": 13, \"city\" : \"Markham\"},\n",
    "      {\"id\": 93, \"city\" : \"Schaumburg\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To refer to an entire array you would just reference the object name.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.phoneno\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: [\"592-533-9042\",\"354-981-0032\",\"919-778-1539\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To reference the first element of an array, you would append an array specifier (square brackets `[]`) with the number representing the position of the element in the array inside the brackets. This number is also referred to as the array index value, or simply the index value. The first element of a JSON array always begins at index value zero. \n",
    "To refer to the first phone number from the above list, we would use this path:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.phoneno[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: \"592-533-9042\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "An index value must be provided, otherwise the Db2 JSON functions will return a null (or an error depending on other settings which we have not yet discussed). The reverse situation, when you specify an index value of zero for a non-array field will cause an error in strict mode and be accepted under lax mode with the contents of the field will be returned. For instance, the following path expression is acceptable to Db2 JSON functions when using lax mode:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.stores[0].city[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: \"Toronto\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "A good development practice would be to define how fields should be created in a document. If a field could potentially have multiple values, then single items should be inserted as arrays with a single value rather than as an atomic item. Examining the document will make it clear that an object could have more than one item in it such as in this example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"phoneno\": [\"592-533-9042\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dealing with arrays of objects is similar to simple objects – an index value is used before traversing down the document. To retrieve the city of the second store of the division would require the following path statement:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$stores[1].city\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: \"Markham\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since stores is an array of objects, we must first select which object in the array needs to be retrieved. The `[1]` represents the second object in the array:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"id\": 13, \"city\" : \"Markham\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We used the dot notation to traverse the contents of the object to refer to the city. Arrays can be nested to many levels and can make path expressions complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next document has two levels of arrays.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"division\": 5,\n",
    "    \"stores\" : \n",
    "    [\n",
    "       {\"id\": 45, \"phone\": [\"592-533-9042\",\"354-981-0032\"]},\n",
    "       {\"id\": 13, \"phone\": [\"634-231-9862\"]},\n",
    "       {\"id\": 93, \"phone\": [\"883-687-1123\",\"442-908-9435\",\"331-991-2433\"]}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To create a path to the second phone number of store 93, we would need to use two array specifications:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.stores[2].phone[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "As the depth of the path expression increases, the potential for errors also becomes higher. One way of reducing the complexity of path expressions is to use two or more steps to traverse a document. For the example above, a user could use the following approach:\n",
    "* stores = using(document) find the contents of `$.stores[2]`\n",
    "* result = using(stores) find the contents of `$.phone[1]`"

    "### Simplifying JSON Path Expressions\n",
    "The previous section illustrated two shortcomings of JSON path expressions:\n",
    "* JSON path expressions can get complex, especially when dealing with arrays and objects within objects\n",
    "* Path expressions are limited to referencing only an individual object, array, or item\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing path expressions, the potential for spelling mistakes goes up as the path gets longer! If the field name is unique in a document, it can be referred to much more easily by using the asterisk (`*`) or wildcard character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wildcard character (asterisk `*`) can be used to match any object in a level or an array. The asterisk does not match all levels in the document, just the immediate one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following document:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"employee\": 10,\n",
    "  \"details\" : \n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"name\": \n",
    "        {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To refer to the last name of the individual in the document, we could write the following path expression:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.details.name.last\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Baklarz\n",
    "```\n",
    "The asterisk can be used to match anything at the current level. The equivalent path expression is:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "$.*.*.last\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Baklarz\n",
    "```\n",
    "This technique is useful when the key is unique but can cause problems when the key is duplicated throughout the document. The next section discusses the use of the wildcard character to retrieve multiple values and the pitfalls associated with it."
