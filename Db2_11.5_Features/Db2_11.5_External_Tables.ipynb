    "### External Tables\n",
    "Db2 11.5 introduces support for External tables. External tables are objects that reside on a local or remote file system that Db2 can create or read as if they were standard SQL tables. The advantage of using external tables for Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) processes is that they can be carried out using plain SQL. Because an SQL-based ETL process can be initiated from any SQL client, it eliminates the need for special ETL tools.\n",

    "Use an external table to: \n",
    "* Load data from an external file into a table in the database\n",
    "* Unload data from the database into an external file\n",
    "* Store data outside the database while retaining the ability to query that data\n",
    "\n",
    "External Table Usage:\n",
    "* Use a FROM clause in a SELECT SQL statement as you would for any other table\n",
    "* Specify the external table as the target table in one of the following SQL statements:\n",
    "  - INSERT SQL\n",
    "  - SELECT INTO SQL\n",
    "  - CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT SQL\n",
    "\n",
