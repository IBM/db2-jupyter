    "Python was concieved in the late 1980s and development was started in 1989. Apparently the original author (Guido van Rossum) was a fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus TV show and that's how it got its name. As with many programming languages, Python was a successor to another programming language called ABC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a garbage collector for memory management and support for Unicode. The biggest change was the adoption of a community-backed process rather than being controlled by a few individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.0 was a major, backwards-incompatible release that was released in 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to Python 2.6 and 2.7. This is an important thing to note about Python. Python 2 and Python 3 have some fundamental differences so some concepts do not port between the versions. Libraries and modules that are developed for Python may be only for a specific release. Fortunately, many of the important libraries are available for both releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has grown in popularity, with it recently being ranked as the number #1 programming language by IEEE Spectrum: https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages. So that probably means it is a good idea to understand what Python is all about!"

    "In summary, you've learned some of the fundamentals of programming in Python. There is still a lot to learn about the language, but this gives you quick introduction into some of things that you can do with it. A lot of useful libraries have been built on top of Jupyter and Python including pandas (an extensive library of plotting and data manipulation functions) as well as database drivers (`ibm-db`) for interacting with Db2 directly from Python. The `%sql` magic command for Db2 is an example of a Jupyter notebook magic command that is used to make it easy to work directly with Db2 without knowing the underlying connection technology."
