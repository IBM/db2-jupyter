    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are based on IPython which started in development in the 2006/7 timeframe. The existing Python interpreter was limited in functionality and work was started to create a richer development environment. By 2011 the development efforts resulted in IPython being released (http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks were a spinoff (2014) from the original IPython project. IPython continues to be the kernel that Jupyter runs on, but the notebooks are now a project on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run in a browser and communicate to the backend IPython server which renders this content. These notebooks are used extensively by data scientists and anyone wanting to document, plot, and execute their code in an interactive environment. The beauty of Jupyter notebooks is that you document what you do as you go along."

    "\n",
    "The Running tab shows you which notebooks are currently active or running. Each notebook is independent from the others. This means that there is no sharing of data or variables between each notebook because they are running on different threads. When you shut down a notebook, you are stopping its process or thread in the system.\n",

Jupyter notebooks have the extension .ipynb (IPython Notebook) which contains all of the notebook information in a JSON format. \n",

Changing the name of the title will make sure any changes get saved under the new name. However, changes will probably have been saved to the old name up to this point because of autosave.

The `File` option gives you options to save the file as a checkpoint (a version that you can revert to), make a copy of the notebook, rename it, or download it. Of particular interest is the `Copy` command. This will make a copy of the existing notebook and start that up in a separate tab in the browser. You can then view and edit this copy rather than changing the original. \n",
