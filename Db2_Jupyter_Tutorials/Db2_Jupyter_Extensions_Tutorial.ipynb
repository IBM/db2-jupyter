    "- **`MAXROWS n (10)`** - The maximum number of rows that will be displayed before summary information is shown. If the answer set is less than this number of rows, it will be completely shown on the screen. If the answer set is larger than this amount, only the first 5 rows and last 5 rows of the answer set will be displayed. If you want to display a very large answer set, you may want to consider using the grid option `-g` to display the results in a scrollable table. If you really want to show all results then setting MAXROWS to -1 will return all output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MAXGRID n (5)`** - The maximum size of a grid display. When displaying a result set in a grid `-g`, the default size of the display window is 5 rows. You can set this to a larger size so that more rows are shown on the screen. Note that the minimum size always remains at 5 which means that if the system is unable to display your maximum row size it will reduce the table display until it fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DISPLAY PANDAS | GRID (PANDAS)`** - Display the results as a PANDAS dataframe (default) or as a scrollable GRID\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`RUNTIME n (1)`** - When using the timer option on a SQL statement, the statement will execute for **`n`** number of seconds. The result that is returned is the number of times the SQL statement executed rather than the execution time of the statement. The default value for runtime is one second, so if the SQL is very complex you will need to increase the run time.\n",

    "- Password - No password is provided so you have to enter a value \n",
    "- Maximum Rows - 10 lines of output are displayed when a result set is returned \n",
    "\n",
    "There will be default values presented in the panels that you can accept, or enter your own values. All of the information will be stored in the directory that the notebooks are stored on. Once you have entered the information, the system will attempt to connect to the database for you and then you can run all of the SQL scripts. More details on the CONNECT syntax will be found in a section below.\n",
